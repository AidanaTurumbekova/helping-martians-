ARRAY: "Helping the Martians" Project

A Martian spaceship crash-landed in a desert on Earth due to engine failure. To continue their journey, the Martians needed to buy spare parts from a city 7 km away. 
Worried that their valuable 713 kg cargo might fall into human hands, they buried it in 3 boxes at different locations along the way,
attaching legs to the boxes to move them if humans approached.

After buying the parts, they realized they had lost the map marking the cargo locations.
A student from Ala-Too University offered to help by writing a program to locate the boxes. The program required entering 3 guesses for the box locations. 
If incorrect, the boxes relocated, and the process repeated until all boxes were found and their combined weight was 713 kg.

After some effort, the Martians recovered their cargo, thanked the student, and promised to invite him to an intergalactic project.
